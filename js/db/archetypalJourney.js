    'The Fool is the Major Arcana’s hero because he is the character most open to change, most in need of change, and most worthy of change by virtue of being guileless and (perhaps naively) unafraid of making mistakes. As E.M. Forster put it, “fools rush in where angels fear to tread.”',
    'The Magician uses the way of the intellect to uncover spiritual secrets; he is an active seeker of knowledge and clarity. He is depicted holding a wand and making the hermetic sign meaning, “as above, so below”. He is also controlling all four symbols of the Minor Arcana (the Jungian four functions), which Campbell considers as meaning, “that any path of life well followed may lead to an opening of the spiritual door, of which he is the guardian.”',
    'The High Priestess is the feminine counterpart of the Magician; she represents the mystical path to spirituality as opposed to the intellectual. Her approach is passive, inwardly-directed, and in no way inferior or less effective to that of the Magician. In fact, any assumption that it could be is probably just a symptom of our cultural bias. Campbell suggests that the Magician and the High Priestess, “might be read as representing, respectively, the Animus and the Anima, complementary images of the ideal male in the psyche of the female and female in the psyche of the male.” As her place below the Lovers in his arrangement implies, she is the initiator of the estate of spiritual love.',
    'The Empress is the power of nature, as opposed to the Emperor who represents the manmade or artificial. She can be a source of abundance, creativity, nourishment, and life but at the same time, she can bring about the destructive forces of natural disasters. Campbell considers the Empress as representing the maturation of the spiritual love of the High Priestess.',
    'As the Father figure, the Emperor is the source of authority and responsibility. While he may at times seem overbearing or critical, he provides the disciplining influence which is the essence of all learning and spirituality. He isn’t opposed to the feminine, or to life. In fact, the Ankh he holds in his right hand represents the life force as a combination of the male and female energies.',
    'The Hierophant is the teacher of religious mysteries and the first suggestion of the underworld of adventure. This, according to Banzhaf, is represented by the fingers of the Hierophant’s right hand: the three fingers pointing upwards symbolise the visible world, while the curled fingers symbolise the hidden world. The five fingers as a whole are the “quintessence”. The hero must travel through both the (conscious) visible world, and the (unconscious) hidden world to find what is essential.',
    'Having realised that there is a world beyond that which they had conceived, the hero must now decide whether or not to leave home and hearth and search for it (in the visible or invisible world). The hero makes this decision with a light, pure heart, and with the best intentions. Banzhaf describes it as a happy union of will and passion, but it can also be the choice between vice and virtue, as the biblical imagery in the Waite-Smith deck attests. This card depicts a pair of lovers because even after the teachings of the Hierophant, love is the ultimate driving force that allows us to make a change. It is also often love that draws us away from our own family for the first time. While this card may feel like the ultimate goal and the end of the road for the character, needless to say they still have a long journey ahead of them. In terms of the Hero’s Journey, this is only the decision to accept or refuse the call to adventure. Finding, in another person, what you lack in yourself, is only the beginning…',
    'The decision made in the Lovers card has spurred the hero on to leave his home and set off in search of adventure. The Chariot represents the pull of opposites. The Charioteer’s job is to keep the two steeds or sphinxes in check, so that neither overbears and topples (or wrecks) the chariot. The horses in the Marseille deck are blue and red, symbolising the body and the soul respectively, while the sphinxes of the Waite-Smith are black and white, with each containing the other’s colour like the yin-yang symbol. This is because everything contains its opposite, and if we examine a binary closely enough, we always find evidence that subverts the binary (c.f. DECONSTRUCTION). Or as Banzhaf puts it: “every time we are certain that we have discovered an evident truth, we can, at one and the same time, be certain that it is not the truth.”',
    'Strength is number eight in the Waite-Smith deck, but its place as the eleventh card brings the character face to face with their first true test of inner strength. It follows on from the Wheel of Fortune by applying pressure to the character’s weak points. The character must “tame the beast within”, accept their shadow side, and welcome their anima or animus. However, it’s important to note that the woman in both the Waite-Smith and the Marseille deck is taming the lion, not by brute force, but through an understanding of the lion’s nature.',
    'With the single digit cards ends the Fool’s sojourn in the realms of light. From now on they are in the dark underworld of adventure. This is the beginning of the inward journey, and for this reason requires some solitary reflection.The hero may hide in a cupboard, or they may go on a NIGHT-SEA JOURNEY.  In this sense, the Hermit is a manifestation of the character. They’ve travelled a long way from The Fool card, where the mountains on the summit of which the Hermit now stands, were far in the distance. But the Hermit can also appear as another person, often a Helper who provides the character with a protective talisman for their crossing. However, Banzhaf points out that even the external Hermit is a manifestation of the hero, the conscious gift of the unconscious. This is also where the character learns their true name. It may be part of the revelation of the heavenly parents, who are often kept secret from the hero. Unfortunately, as Banzhaf writes, finding our true name isn’t the end of the battle. Henceforward, our work in life will be to stay loyal to it and not to betray it.',
    'Banzhaf describes the commandment of the Wheel of Fortune thus: “Seek the treasure that is hard to find!” This is the card that clarifies the character’s goal, and what truly provided me with an epiphany in Banzhaf’s reading was his suggestion that our life’s work is not to pursue what you (or your character) is good at. On the contrary, the figure that speaks to the character from the Wheel of Fortune is the one that demands more attention. It’s their weaknesses that have sent the character on this Fool’s Journey in the first place, and until they’re strengthened, the character will keep encountering the same problems. If one of the character’s four parents is branded as an “evil step-mother”, then the character’s work is to stop shunning them, and instead uncover the truth about their relationship. There may also be other universal or PERSONAL ARCHETYPES recurring in their life, and bringing their own teachings. In the Waite-Smith deck, the figures in each corner all hold books which disappear in the World card, when they’ve reached a holistic understanding. But at this stage, they still have a lot to learn…',
    'This is the card that is switched with Strength in the order of the Waite-Smith deck. Banzhaf replaces it as number eight because, according to him, Justice marks the point of separation with the ordinary world. In the monomyth, this is when the hero reaches the first crossing. The figure of Justice represents the old laws the hero is leaving behind and the new laws (of the new world) that are drawing them into their power. The character must be ready and willing to take on responsibility, but unlike the choice of the Lovers card, Justice, with her prominent right foot, represents a more considered, rational approach.',
    'This card represents an existential crisis. This is when the character questions the purpose they took on in the Wheel of Fortune, and in fact, the whole journey up to this point. While unity lies at the motionless centre of the wheel, and the struggle of daily life on the outside, the character stuck in this stage is the hamster running along the inner surface of the wheel. Their whole experience of life is turned upside down, and until their perspective shifts to match their experience, they will be kept suspended. This is where Banzhaf considers Dante’s Divine Comedy begins: “Midway upon the journey of our life…”, although in CAMPBELL’S ARRANGEMENT, it falls in the second column, ‘Age’. Campbell considers the Hanging Man a symbol of “indifference to social approval,” and being dead to public opinion. No story typifies this better (in my opinion), than Saul Bellow’s Dangling Man. Nevertheless, the Hanging Man’s face is calm, and there’s a halo around his head, suggesting that this state can be overcome, even if it is only a preparation for the next card – Death.',
    'Death is a card that engenders fear, and the sooner the character learns to accept that fear instead of spending all of their energies trying to avoid the inevitable, the better (at least for them, perhaps not for story tension). Death requires something to be left behind. While this will feel like a hard sacrifice for the character, they will never make it while they’re carrying around “dead weight.” How to cope with such radical change? Campbell writes: “What is required is the finding of that Immovable Point within one’s self, which is not shaken by any of those tempests which the Buddhists call ‘the eight karmic winds’: fear or pain, desire for pleasure; fear of loss, desire for gain; fear of blame, desire for praise; fear of disgrace, desire for fame.”',
    'Between the violence of Death and the Devil, stands the serene figure of Temperance. Banzhaf casts her as the guide to the underworld, and writes that the guide has always been there, but unseen and unheard. This reminds me forcibly of the deaths in The Amber Spyglass (which I talked a little about in THIS POST ABOUT THE NIGHT-SEA JOURNEY). In feeling, it also seems akin to the Emily Dickinson poem:..., The challenge of Temperance is to find a middle ground between being dead to physical existence (Death) and being chained to it (Devil) by our vices or excessive passions. This is the key to making it out of the underworld alive.',
    'The Devil represents the dark side of the anima/animus, as depicted by the chained lovers. However, Banzhaf notes that the chains are so loose that it would actually be easy for the lovers to escape, if only they were aware that they had been imprisoned, and by what. Furthermore, this bondage doesn’t come about because of some inherent evil, but because we attribute certain characteristics to our shadow self and expend our energies in ignoring, shunning, and disparaging it. ',
    'The destruction of the Tower is the sign that the old world has become too confining. All towers, whether the ivory tower, Rapunzel’s tower, or the Two Towers, eventually come to signify the limits of the ego and its divisiveness. The Tower is the stage at which the character can show a side of themselves that no one would have suspected existed. It is the sign that you can achieve the unthinkable, as Luke does when he hits the impossible target. The destruction isn’t the annihilation of the Death Star, but Luke’s belief in the targetting computer over the power of the Force. Banzhaf notes that the more self-important, arrogant and proud we are, the harder the Tower falls. It requires us to re-evaluate all of our world-views, opinions and limitations, and although this can feel like the end, it’s actually the beginning of a greater connection to the universe.',
    'Now we come to the three cards that represent a gradual lightening and emergence from the underworld: the Star, the Moon and the Sun. The worst is now behind our hero, although their work isn’t done. The Star is there to guide them to the next stage. The Star represents a respite after the narrowness of the Tower and the violence of its destruction. It brings a sense of inner and outer calm and abundance. The card depicts the water of life, which, Banzhaf says, is valuable more by virtue of its inaccessibility than its properties. As in Fantasia, it lies at the boundaries of the kingdom, but this is the inner kingdom of the limitless unconscious. The hero learnt the laws of the material world in Justice, and now it’s time for them to learn the laws of the cosmos.',
    'The Moon represents a strange, changeable landscape that can easily confuse and trap the hero. Lyra in Lord Asriel’s house at the end of Northern Lights is in just such a place. Although the character has triumphed, they must still navigate the dangerous return journey back to the ordinary world. The underworld is tricky and enticing, and can easily entrap the hero for eternity, as it does with Persephone. Are the dogs in the card guarding the way in or out? The hero must extricate themselves from the temptations of the underworld, return to the world of the living and bring with them the elixir of life, if they are to succeed fully. The Moon is the greatest threat to losing their true name, but to characters who are prepared and who are adept at traversing their inner landscape, it is also the greatest opportunity. This is the test of whether a character is truly the master of two worlds, and can cross and recross the treacherous threshold.',
    'The Sun is the stage at which the character finally leaves the underworld of adventure and returns to the light, ordinary world. Looking back from this vantage point, the character realises that the enormous difficulties they just wrestled with actually boil down to a simple solution; that they would have triumphed much sooner had they not complicated the problem. Now their task is to begin readjusting to the ordinary world, and reconciling the change in their inner world to the lack of change in the outer world.',
    'The Judgement card represents a final test of the character’s worthiness to be the bearer of the elixir of life. If, by some chance, a false hero has managed to come this far, this is the stage at which they will be discovered and sent back to the underworld. On the other hand, for the true hero, Judgement brings resurrection; a revitalising influence that is the final, freeing reward of their long journey.',
    'The World in the Rider-Waite deck is the inverse of the Hanged Man. One reason for this is that the World is the resolution of the readjustment brought about in the crisis of the Hanged Man. The World brings unity to the opposites that have been battling for supremacy over the hero throughout their journey: dark & light, good & bad, action & inaction, male & female. This isn’t because the world is suddenly free of strife, but because the character has accepted and dealt with both sides of the duality and thus earned freedom from them. However temporary this freedom might be…',
