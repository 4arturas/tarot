    'The Fool stands for the innocence of the child. So he means openness and playful approach to life as well as the not-realising of danger and naivity. The openness and innocence of a child can be refreshing, making new experiences and mental suppleness possible. But these characteristics can become dangerous if they turn into starry-eyed credulity. Furthermore, the Fool`s playful approach to everything he meets can incline to irresponsibility and the disability to keep to engagements. On a more abstract level the Fool means the beginning, the starting point. He is the begin of life, the begin of the development of a human being. The card 0 The Fool is the starting point of a long journey of which the card XXI The World is the final point.',
    'The Magician symbolises the ability to influence the course of life, the world. He symbolises the power that is gained by knowledge and competency. Thus, he stands for constructiveness and initiative. The Magician means that mastership is there, that the own fate can be mastered actively. Dangerous the Magician can be if he misuses his power, his knowledge and his charisma to manipulate others.',
    'The High Priestess stands for intuition and (intuitive) wisdom, for empathy, forebodings, patience and understanding. She does not need to intervene at once when things don\'t go according to her will or not well at the moment - she knows that everything happens in cycles and that bad things will pass and good things will come again and the other way around. The High Priestess can sit still and watch changes with compassion and serenity. She can devote herself - to others, to her feelings, to her inner voice. She strives to touch the world with her soul and become one with it. In her exaggerated, perverted form the High Priestess can be a manipulating sourceress or fall into deep depression.',
    'The Empress is the archetype "Mother". To her meaning all that belongs which is associated with "Mother. She means growth, vibrance, furtility, physicalness, nature, the forces and cycles of nature, creative and spontaneous constructiveness, the "lioness-mother" who defends what and who she loves with superhuman strength and with her live, the unconditional love of the mother which does not have to be earned, and many positive aspects more. The Empress can be a warm-hearted, strong-willed, empathic and protective ruler. But she has negative aspects also. She can destroy as suddenly as she creates - nature does not only mean warm sunshine and soft rain but also destroying forces. Just as she sometimes loves unconditionally and without cause she sometimes does hate without cause. Her love cannot be gained by good deeds. The Empress can be possessive, suffocating, a sitting hen, a cruel tyrant with no sense for rationality. It is important that she represents the "female" form of rulership - she is the female counterpart of the Emperor.',
    'The Emperor is the archetype "Father". To his meaning all that belongs which is associated with "Father". He means law and order, duty, responsibility, rationality, self-confidence and rules. Rewards and punishments are dealt out according to assignable criteria. The good will of the Emperor can be earned with achievments. He represents stability, structure, discipline, organising ability and many positive aspects more. The Emperor can be a strong-willed, just, rational and assertive ruler. But there are some negative aspects also: rigidity, strictness, disability to show emotions, coldness of feeling, missing connection between mind and soul and/or mind and body, despotism and disability to be creative or spontaneous. The Emperor can be a cold, indifferent, merciless tyrant. It is important that he represents the "male" form of rulership - he is the male counterpart of the Empress.',
    'The High Priest represents the Holy, the Saint. He stands for the search of and the finding of meaning and truth, he stands for religiousness, believe and comprehension. Furthermore, he means deep trust, protection and good advice. He asks us to follow our calling and to trust in life the Good our Buddha Nature God... He warns us against hypocrisy and a smug holier-than-thou attitude.',
    'One of the many meanings of the Lovers is indeed the state of being in love of a new couple. But the main aspect of the card\'s meaning is best described as the love of a couple who live with each other from the time of their comming together until their death, full of respect and loving care for each other. This is the love of two people who have decided to choose each other, and who have the will and the strength to keep to this choice even in difficult times. So this cards essentially stands for the full-hearted decision, for the unconditional "Yes". In many cases this will indeed be the Yes to a romantic relationship, but it could also be the Yes to a child, to more responsibility in your job, to a spiritual path, to a house you want to buy... But always it is a Yes that implies the willingness to take responsibility for that which you have said "yes" to, the willingness to treat it with care and mindfulness, to protect it - to treat it with love. And all this means (at least where a relationship is concerned) that you fullheartedly agree to do this forever.',
    'The Chariot symbolises the energetic, hopeful departure of the hero into the unknown, into adventure, into life. He sets off, all ready to assume a risk, to find the pot of honey at the end of the rainbow, to dig up the treasure, to kill the dragon, to rescue the princess. This is the attitude you need to get out of a gridlocked situation, out of a confining relationship. This is the attitude you need to make a true new beginning, to truly broaden your horizon. The danger is, of course, to out of high spirits take risks which end fatally - like Phaeton who let the chariot of the Sun get out of control and crashed down to earth. Adventuresomeness and courage is not the same as improvidence and overestimating one\'s capabilities.',
    'The card Justice means, well: justice. Thereto belong besides fairness also objectivity, dispassion, the ability to keep a clear, cool head, discernment and reason. For me it is escpecially important that Justice means the ability to discriminate between good and evil, right and wrong, and not to be shy of making these discriminations. Only those who can make them are truly responsible for themselves and for others. Justice also means to have a feeling for appropriateness, for balanced distribution. To be just means to want and actively boost a balanced distribution even if this means the loss of privileges for yourself. The card is problematic where it stands for exaggerated black-and-white thinking, the non-tolerance of ambiguity, premature sentences and the missing of clemency.',
    'The Hermit is the archetype of the Old Wise Man. He retreats into quietness and silence, he practises abstinence, self-restraint and asceticism and looks for guidance in himself rather than others. He strives to be authentic, to know and live his will, to not be influenced by others. The Hermit lives with himself, in himself, and out of himself. The Hermit can be problematic when his habit of retreating drives him into insulation, makes him afraid of people or bitter and hard, or when he begins to over-estimate his wisdom and becomes smug.',
    'The Wheel of Fortune stands for an experience which every human being makes sooner or later: There are so many things we cannot influence. Blows of fate happen to us "just like that", imperatives force us onto certain paths, lovingly and carefully prepared plans are baffled. We are happy, our needs are met, we feel safe - and suddenly the Wheel turns and we fall very deep. The Wheel of fortune tells us to learn to deal with the insecurities and necessities, the ups and downs of life in an acitve, positive way. If we can see and treat defeats, blows of fate, and suffering, as a source of learning, of understanding, and of wisdom, we won\'t feel at fate\'s mercy anymore. If we are conscious that good times are a gift and that bad times might come soon, we will enjoy and cherish the good times much more. If we don\'t learn to productively deal with the fateful, the coincidental, we will soon resign, develop fatalistic ideas and live in constant fear.',
    'This card stands for the balance between the Virgin and the Lioness in us, the balance between body and mind, between intellect and passion, rationality and instinct. If our Virgin part, the mind, becomes too strong, we become passionless, cold and top-heavy. If the Lioness part takes prevalence, we fall into addictions and incline more and more towards self-destructive and aggressive behaviour. We must learn to let the Virgin keep the Lioness under gentle control, not letting her have her way all the time but nevertheless not suppressing her. The lioness must be cherished, and the Virgin must know when to let her bare her teeth. If we manage this, we have inexhaustible energy and strength for everything, we are passionate, both with body and mind present at what we are doing, and we have charisma and assertiveness.',
    'The Hanged Man is the archetype of the Prisoner or of the Prison or of the Victim. He stands for stagnation, for being gridlocked, for being passive and in the mercy of an oppressive situation; he can mean illness and abandonment. The positive side of the Hanged Man is that forced deadlocks, illnesses and abandonment can lead to completely new views - even new world outlooks. Many people tell that just before their change of life to the good they experienced an extremely painful phase of deadlock, of stagnation. So the Hanged Man can mean that it is necessary to "turn round", to "turn upside down" - to radically change one\'s views and ways of living. Else we will remain hanging, being caught and suffering.',
    'I know it probably sounds strange, but: Death is one of my favourite cards. For if you have learned to let go, to not try to hold on to that which is already passing, then you will realise that the painful process of something\'s ending can be a great relief and also the begin of something new and beautiful. The card does not mean that you or a loved one will die. Of course: if your question was about the mortal illness of someone you know, the card can indicate that you should look into the subject of death and dying. But the main meaning of Death is the natural end of something. This can be the end of a life; but mostly it will be the end of a long-cherished but wrong conviction, the end of a way of life or of a phase of life, the end of a friendship or a relationship, or even the end of an addiction. The important thing is that this end is a natural end - there is no way to avoid it. You could probably try to avoid it, but then you\'d soon begin to feel not-alive and numbed. If you want to be reborn you have to die first. This is of course a painful and frightening process. But only those who go through it all the way will be able to begin something which is truly new.',
    'The most important meaning of Temperance for me is balance. Balance in your way of life, in your emotions, in the way you treat your body, in dealing with others, in your job, in love - balance in all the spheres of your life. The card also stands for serenity, peace of mind and humility. Temperance does not know excess, exaggeration, bragging or aggression. She has no need for them: she is filled with peace and with contentedness with what the moment has to offer.',
    'The Devil stands for everything that is concerned with excess and falsehood. He means lie and betrayal, (self)delusion and deceitfulness. He stands for crapulence, uncontrolled passions and lewdness, for aggression, ignorance, wastage, laziness and bragging. He basically means that something is out of balance. He can mean addiction and bondage, seduction, blackmailing and misuse of power, and he stands for treason and for not sticking to one\'s principles.\n' +
    'In very few cases I do read the Devil in a positive way. I do this if the person I read the cards for is passionless, is hostile against their body and its needs, or is morally overly correct to the point of harming themselves. In these rare cases I read the Devil as an invitation to enjoy (physical) life for a change, to feast, not to feel guilty for the tiniest moral transgression. Such positive readings of the Devil should stay an exception, though.',
    'The Tower stands for upheavals, sudden and violent changes and revolutions, breakdowns. Old securities collapse, the whole world outlook is destroyed. Nothing can be the same afterwards. Such experiences are always extremely frightening, they are percieved to be a threat to existence. Still: there is so much potential in them also. Many mystics of all faiths tell that before their experience of oneness or before the experience of meeting God they went through a total breakdown. Only this breakdown of everything they had though true and secure opened the door to reality as it really is. Often, the Tower stands for a wall of defence which does not safeguard us as we intended when building it but which cuts us off from life. Only if this defending wall breaks down completely can we be truly alive again. And sometimes we build our world outlook on false and rotten fundaments. It is not enough then to just remove a few bricks from the pinnacles and build a new roof. The only chance to start something truly new on safe, strong fundaments is a total collapse right to the fundaments itself.',
    'The Star symbolises both hope and wisdom. To the levels of her meaning also belong confidence and the prospect of healing, of peace, of becomeing whole, of processes with a steady, happy course. The wisdom of the Star is the wisdom you gain through an open, broad view and a habitus of gentleness and compassion.',
    'The Moon stands for the unconscious, the dark, the shadow sides of life. It symbolises the journey to the deepest abysm of the soul, to the irrational source of life. The Moon stands for times in which you meet your primal fears, times of mourning and sadness. It stands for everything which is dark and hidden, which is not accessible with reason, which cannot be described with words. A beautiful and also positive card the Moon is for me because only the acceptance of the dark sides of life can give depth to the experience of the light sides of life. Still, it can be dangerous, because those who look at the Moon only and not at the Sun also will soon become caught in depression or even psychosis.',
    'The Sun stands for happiness, light and warmth - for vitality and joy of life. It symbolises the light sides of life and means everything that is positive, fulfilled and joyful. It means pure optimism. This card is only problematic if the joy stays purely on the surface and/or is used to repress and shut out the dark sides of life.',
    'Judgement symbolises redemption; it symbolises the rising from the dark of the grave into a light new world, into a new life. Experiences related to Judgement can be all-inclusive, major redemptions like for example the salvation from a mental illness or the sudden recovery from a mortal physical illness, it can be the rescue from unbearable dependencies and so on. But such experiences are of course rare. So in most cases Judgement will stand for more daily experiences such as the solving of a problem, the feeling of relief and relaxation after an exam...',
    'The World is the card with the maybe most beautiful meaning in the whole deck. It symbolises Becoming One - both in the sense of the integration of all aspects of the personality and in the sense of oneness with the cosmos. It means the experience of enlightenment, of Nirvana, of God. Another level of the meaning of the World is the feeling to have finally found your place in the world, to have found your spiritual home. A more positive card you cannot draw. The World symbolises the kind of having arrived where you are not soon bored and are driven to leave again - this arrival is eternal. The World symbolises the recovered paradise.',

    'Aces can be read as chances that lie in our environment or in ourselves. The Ace of Swords means that we have the chance now to clear things which had been unclear or incomprehensible. We have the chance to dissolve entanglements, to resolve conflicts. Basically the Ace of Swords means that now is the time to put some distance between us and our problems and look at them with a cool head and a clear mind. Out of this perspective we will be able to understand them better.',
    'The Two of Swords mean the unpleasant doubts that creep over us if we have lost the connection with our centre, our intuition. With the intellect alone we can\'t make decisions which satisfy, which feel right - even if they are right. So either we cannot hear our inner voice, or we kowingly try to drown it out and solve our problems with our head alone. But if the heart is not involved our doubts won\'t disappear.',
    'The Three of Swords are often read as lovesickness, and this is indeed one of their meanings. But the main aspect of this card is the decision that is made against the heart, a decision against the feelings. This can be the right step if our feelings want something which is harmful for us. But often we make a decision against our hearts because we are afraid of failure, of being hurt. In such cases a decision like this is very problematic.',
    'The Four of Swords stand for a time like the numbed, exhausted, almost senseless state during or after a very high fever. This is a time in which we fall into a kind of hibernation because of the pains that we have suffererd or are still suffering. We need this time of complete passivity, of motionlessness and silence because else we couldn\'t deal with the suffering. The danger is that we might remain caught in this condition even though it has long become time to get up and be alive again.',
    'This card is one of the few solely negative Tarot cards. None of its many meanings is positive. The Five of Swords mean humiliation, wanton destruction of the whole, injuring of the innocent, violence, vindictiveness, in short: any form of perfidy that you could imagine. By the way, the card does not say whether these are things that happen to us as a victim or whether we ourselves are the wrongdoers.',
    'The Six of Swords describe a departure into the unknown.\n' +
    'This departure does not happen voluntarily, at least not fully, and the arrival is anticipated with great tentativeness. Maybe this situation is a bit like the one of the emigrants who left Europe and went to America in the past centuries because they were being prosecuted because of their religious denomination. They were forced to give up their home, and they took their wounds with them on their journey. The destination was anticipated both with hope and with fear.',
    'This card stands for furtiveness and perfidiousness. It can mean material theft or plagiarism, stealthiness, unwholesome secrets, lies, betrayal, hypocrisy, defamation and deception. The Seven of Swords do not say whether it is others treating us like this or whether we ourselves are the wrongdoers.',
    'The Eight of Swords mean that there is a part of ourselves which we don\'t let be alive. There is a part which we try to shut away. The card means that we are inhibited because we try too much to control ourselves, to inflict prohibitions on ourselves. This leads to the feeling of not being truly alive, to the feeling of not really being in touch with ourselves and the world around us. In very rare cases the card can indicate that it is necessary to restrict ourselves in this way to prevent greater damage.',
    'The Nine of Swords mean doubt, self-reproaches, feelings of guilt, grief and worries that keep us awake at night, they stand for pondering and for the anxcious, pessimistic anticipation of things which might happen. The card stands for (inner) crisis, for fear and nightmares. In the worst case this leads to complete despair. In the best case it will in the end make us wiser.',
    'The Ten of Swords mean a forcible, violent end. This end can be the end of a relationship, it can mean dismissal or the sudden death of a loved person. Whatever form this end has: it will be an end full of pain, an experience that we go through recieving serious wounds. The only positive thing about this is that sometimes we have to rule something off even if it is extremely painful because else we would suffer even deeper wounds. The painful end the Ten of Swords desribe does not imply that we couldn\'t heal again after a time of mourning.',
    'I tend to reading the Pages as invitations to cultivate certain mental attitudes or to inwardly prepare for certain ways of acting.\n' +
    'The Page of Swords invites us to prepare for conflicts, for clarifying discussions, for criticism. But he warns us of being overly fierce; we should prepare not for a fight but for a conflict for which we need objective, realistic points and not the taunts of a diatribe.',
    'Like the other knights the Knight of Swords stands for a certain spirit, and in his case this is the spirit of discord, quarrel and threat. In situations in which the Knight of Swords is prevailing there can also be ice cold vibes or exaggerated, emotionless sobriety. The good thing about this card is that it can call our attention to a long existing conflict which we should begin to try and resolve, because else we would just keep carrying it around with us. This is the time to face the conflict with a clear head.',
    'You can see the Queen of Swords as a woman with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a man, as the female part of his psyche. But I tend to reading the queens as the inward side of a person (philosophy of life, attitude towards life, values, habitus, typical moods...), no matter whether this person is female or male.\n' +
    'The Queen of Swords is an intelligent, witty woman who in many cases has known great suffering. Mental independence means everything to her; to gain it she will even seal herself off from her feelings. This is why many people will think her cool or even cold. The Queen of Swords strives for insight and clearness; opacity and entanglements are an abhorrence to her.\n' +
    'She is problematic especially if she does really become cold and calculating and if she is so caught in her intellectual hights that she completely shuts out the physical and emotional reality.',
    'You can see the King of Swords as a man with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a woman, as the male part of her psyche. But I tend to reading the kings as the outward side of a person (job, typical ways of acting, the way the life is led...), no matter whether this person is male or female.\n' +
    'The King of Swords is an intelligent, reasonable, rational, pensive man. He can be very witty and adroit, which makes him a great entertainer. You typically meet him in jobs in which critical distachment, objectivity, and clear, abstract thinking are required. If you are entangled in a complicated (intellectual) problem and can go neither back nor forth, the King of Swords will help you. But he is not unproblematic. He can be undercooled and top-headed; he has great difficulties dealing with emotions - he will even refuse trying to. Also, he inclines towards perfectionism and excessive, inappropriate critisicm. That he often hurts people with his sharp tongue he does not even know.',

    'Aces can be read as chances that lie in our environment or in ourselves. The Ace of Rods stands for new doorways that open up to us, new paths that are discovered. What had been too risky can be chanced now. This is the chance for us to develope through something we happen upon, something that offers itself to us.',
    'The Two of Rods mean a situation in which we feel damned to inaction because we have to make a choice between several paths and can\'t decide. The readiness is missing to engage in anything; we feel lethargic, numbed and at the same time under great pressure. But we just don\'t have the energy and determination needed to depart on one of our possible paths. On another level of meaning the Two of Rods can mean lip services, half-heartedness and having no standpoint. Sometimes an attitude of neutrality, of not-choosing can be appropriate. But if it makes you feel numbed it surely isn\'t.',
    'The Three of Rods mean that we have good expectations because we have gained a strong basis onto which we can build safely. They mean that we can hope for success confidently, and that we needn\'t hesitate if we want to start projects which are more difficult and time consuming. The card invites us to awaken to what we want to reach long-term.',
    'This card stands for a situation in which we can depart into the new trustingly and confidently. A feeling of harmony and security is prevailing; now is the time to meet new people, to enter new doors, to be open. The Four of Rods can also mean that we are welcome where we are going or that we should welcome others.',
    'The Five of Rods describe a situation of playful fighting, of sportive or verbal contest. This is about showing what you can, about meeting your rivals, about clarifying your views. But this fight is playful, there isn\'t much aggression, and the participants stay quite peaceful.',
    'The Six of Rods stand for success, victory, recognition and popularity, for gains and solutions. But there is quite a strong warning implied not to make the mistake of bragging or getting too worked up about one\'s victory. Only too quickly a winner can become a loser again.',
    'The Seven of Rods describe a situation full of conflicts, of quarrel. We are attacked and have to defend ourselves. In most cases this fight is not about bagatelles; there is quite a lot at stake. The aggression which we encounter is considerable, the attackers sometimes use drastic means. Now is the time to mobilise all our strength, all our recources, and to fight back as hard as we can. The Seven of Rods also mean that it is quite likely that we fight from a favourable position and have good chances to win.',
    'Now, this is a very strange card that reliably embarrasses me when it turns up in a reading for someone. For it does mean news - nothing much more. It means news that have not arrived yet but are soon going to arrive. Beyond this there isn\'t really anything to say about the Eight of Rods. One way to wriggle out of my embarrassment is saying that new impulses are always good and that the Eight of Rods indicate that something will change at last.',
    'The Nine of Rods mean defiance, refusal, and obstinacy. We believe that we have been hurt or wronged or laughed at, and so we refuse to accept offers of reconciliation or other gestures of love. We turn away from that which in truth we need so much.\n' +
    'The card can also show that we feel frightened and threatened although in truth no one wants to do us any harm. And it can mean that we bristle against changes and hold on tightly to the established.',
    'This card describes a situation of excessive demands, of the feeling of being totally overtaxed, beset, of having burdened oneself with far too much or something we are not equal to. Furthermore, the Ten of Rods can mean hopelessness, despair and lacking prospects for the future. The card asks us not to try to handle this situation alone and without help.',
    'I tend to reading the Pages as invitations to cultivate certain mental attitudes or to inwardly prepare for certain ways of acting.\n' +
    'The Page of Rods invites us to develope an open attitude, as free as possible of prejudice, to be curious. Only then new impulses, opening doorways and inspriations can be recognised and accepted.',
    'Like the other knights the Knight of Pentacles stands for a certain spirit, and in his case this is the spirit of hot-bloodedness, adventuresomeness, joy of exploration and conquest, impatience, energy, zest for life, passion and enthusiasm. There is no thoughtfulness, no "let\'s first think about it" - acting is everything. Of course, if you are in such a spirit you should take care not to put yourself in danger or become reckless towards others. Barring this, the Knight of Rods indicates that now is the time to sort things out, to at last tackle what you had long planned.',
    'You can see the Queen of Rods as a woman with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a man, as the female part of his psyche. But I tend to reading the queens as the inward side of a person (philosophy of life, attitude towards life, values, habitus, typical moods...), no matter whether this person is female or male.\n' +
    'The Queen of Rods is a self-confident, passionate woman. Self-actualisation, self-determination and independence mean the world to her. If she is confined, caged, if she is hinderd to move about freely, she can\'t be happy. Relationships can be difficult for her for that reason. She is courageous, always sticks by her opinions and is full of energy because she always knows what she wants.\n' +
    'The Queen of Rods can be problematic if she becomes reckless from her passion, and when she inclines towards bragging, self-dramatisation and overestimating her capabilities.',
    'You can see the King of Rods as a man with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a woman, as the male part of her psyche. But I tend to reading the kings as the outward side of a person (job, typical ways of acting, the way the life is led...), no matter whether this person is male or female. The King of Rods is a strong-willed, assertive man who does not allow others to influence him in any way. Concerning his work he will typically be found in leading positions. Since he is dynamic, passionate and enthusiastic most people will find him charismatic and will admire him. He can make great things become real. The King of Rods is problematic when his other characteristics are joined by unwillingness to compromise and the disability to keep within his limits.',

    'Aces can be read as chances that lie in our environment or in ourselves. The Ace of Cups is the chance of love in all its forms. It can mean romantic love, the loving of a child or of your parents, friendship and charity. The card indicates that we have the chance now to find one or the other of these forms of love; it means that we should live and express them.',
    'The Two of Cups mean a certain aspect of love: romantic love. Here everything is about love at first sight, falling and being in love, butterflies in your stomach - about the first phase of a relationship. But the Two of Cups can also mean a loving but non-romantic encounter, the open going up to each other, or an act of charity or reconciliation.',
    'The Three of Cups describe a situation similar to Thanksgiving; they describe the feeling of happiness and gratitude in the face of the beautiful, the good, the nourishing, love... which we have recieved from life or our fellow human beings. This is a time of festivity, of saying thanks, of pausing and being happy with the gifts of the moment.',
    'The Four of Cups describe a situation of oversaturation, of overabundance. The card means that we have taken too much, that we have given in to gluttony or that too much or the wrong things are being offered to us. This leads to a feeling of tedium, of annoyance, of (self)disgust. On a different level of meaning the Four of Cups can also mean feeling affronted or being snooty.',
    'This card stands for an attitude in which sorrow, loss and mourning cannot be handled constructively anymore but are met with passivity. We stay in the ruins of the destroyed house, looking only at our misfortune and not at the lighter outlooks that could be seen if only we turned away from the ruins a bit. The Five of Cups prompt us to let go of this attitude and try to "tidy up" the ruins and then turn to happier things.',
    'The Six of Cups stand for a time of romantic puppy-love. They mean an attitude in which we stubbornly only look at that which is beautiful and try to convince ourselves that everything is positive and friendly. The card can also mean nostalgia; the wistful looking back to the past. This can go so far that because of dreaminess reality can hardly be seen anymore.',
    'This card means illusion, self-delusion and sometimes even halluzination. It means that we see things which aren\'t there. Maybe we believe we are beeing followed, maybe we believe we are being loved by someone who in truth would rather not have anything to do with us and feels stalked by us. Maybe we believe things are fine although they are not fine at all. In any case: these are not harmless vanities. The contact with reality has been lost.',
    'This card stands for a departure full of wistfulness which nevertheless happens of our own free will. Mostly we depart because we have realised that it is high time to walk a different path, our own path. It is time for us to be independent, to let go of old securities and convictions. So this departure is connected with wistfulness and a heavy heart, but staying would just confine us and make true advancements impossible.',
    'This card means a time of jubilance, of joy, of festivity. It is a time of harmony and conviviality, of friendship and carefree ease. A beautiful card which only contains the tiniest warning not to fall into irresponsible crapulousness.',
    'The Ten of Cups mean the experience of deep contentment, of having arrived. They can mean that we have completed an important stage of our development. We feel deep contentment, happiness and harmony - nothing is wanting.\n' +
    'The only tiny warning of this card is for me that, yes, for a while we can bathe in this feeling of having arrived and being contented. But it is very likely to pass again. New challenges wait for us. We have completed an important stage of our development; sooner or later it will be time to begin to tackle the next one.',
    'I tend to reading the Pages as invitations to cultivate certain mental attitudes or to inwardly prepare for certain ways of acting.\n' +
    'The Page of Cups invites us to turn to our inner self, our soul, and to look for the well of love, sympathy, harmony and readiness for reconciliation there. He invites us to drink from this well and then turn back to the outside world and to approach every being with this love, sympathy, harmony and readiness for reconciliation.',
    'Like the other knights the Knight of Cups stands for a certain spirit, and in his case this is the spirit of (romantic) dreaminess. It is the spirit in which we make choices according to our feelings, in which we fall in love. The Cup Knight can also mean that it is time to approach an enemy peacefully; being in the spirit of reconciliation makes a real reconciliation much more likely. But there is also a warning in this card: we should be careful not to fall into naivity, credulity, or bigheaded, inappropriate helpfulness.',
    'You can see the Queen of Cups as a woman with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a man, as the female part of his psyche. But I tend to reading the queens as the inward side of a person (philosophy of life, attitude towards life, values, habitus, typical moods...), no matter whether this person is female or male. The Queen of Cups is a sensitive, artistic, emotional, intuitive woman. She is empathic and cuddly. A loving encounter with the world and her fellow human beings is of great importance to her; she bears conflicts and quarrel only with difficulties. She needs a lot of time for herself, time in which she can nourish her spiritual and artistic side. The Queen of Cups can be problematic if naivity, blind belief in the Good, escapism and emotional dependence are added to the above characteristics.',
    'You can see the King of Cups as a man with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a woman, as the male part of her psyche. But I tend to reading the kings as the outward side of a person (job, typical ways of acting, the way the life is led...), no matter whether this person is male or female.\n' +
    'The King of Cups is a sensitive, intuitiv, warm-hearted, feeling man who typically works as an artist, doctor, therapist, healer, mediator or similar. He is always ready to help and to care for others, and he is looking for wisdom and spiritual fulfilment. If you meet a person like this you should make sure, though, that these characteristics are true and not just pretended to seduce or manipulate you.',

    'Aces can be read as chances that lie in our environment or in ourselves. The Ace of Pentacles stands for a treasure that is yet hidden but that we could soon find if only we keep our eyes open. Some kind of gift is waiting for us - it is already there, we just need to find it. This treasure could be a new friendship, a pregnancy, a good business or an inspiration - no matter what it is, it is up to us to know it for what it is and dig it up.',
    'The Two of Pentacles stand for situations in which we have to choose between two or more possibilities but in which we feel unable to make this choice. Instead, we juggle with them, play with them. Such an attitude can be positive if there are no pressing reasons to make a decision, or if we don\'t have enough information yet for a responsible decision. Then, playing with the different possibilities might lead to a better feeling for the pros and cons. This attitude is definitely negativ if others suffer because of it, or if we just act that way because we want to try to evade the final decision.',
    'The Three of Pentacles mean that we have completed our apprenticeship and are ready to be a master. The card says that we have learned enough to work independently, to live or to love independently and so on. So the Three of Pentacles can mean that we have passed an exam, that we successfully managed a difficult situation, that we haven risen to a new phase of our development... But even though our pride in this is justified we shouldn\'t try to appear bigger than we are; there is always something new to learn.',
    'This card describes a hoarding, saving to niggardly way of acting. The hoarding can be the hoarding of money or property but also the holding on to convictions or similar. Acting like this does make some sense if we know that times of insuffeciency are coming. But in most cases the Four of Pentacles mean compulsivity, holding fast to money or to property or to the well-known because of an exorbitant need for security, niggardliness and greed.',
    'The Five of Pentacles stand for a time of mental, physical or material hardship, for times of deficiency and of depriviation. But they do also imply that comfort can be found in such situations in partners, friends or unexpectedly compassionate strangers. The card invites us to look for help and to accept help that is offered to us.',
    'The Six of Pentacles are all about the topic of giving and taking. They mean to generously give that of which there is too much to those who have not enough of it. The card does not give a hint on which side we are: we could be the one who gives or the one who takes. The card can mean that we are in a situation in which we have to go to others and beg for something, and that we have to accept whatever they are willing to give. No matter on which side we are the card means there should be a balance. Neither should we give too little nor too much. And we should neither ask for what we don\'t need nor out of pride not ask for what we do need.',
    'This card wants us to have patience. We should have patience with a project, with a situation. We should give someone time to mature, to develop. The Seven of Pentacles also stand for times of growth that have to be gone through with serenity and patience so that the fruits can afterwards be enjoyed.',
    'The Eight of Pentacles mean that we are in a situation of learning, of apprenticeship. We are still in need of a master, of guidance. The card warns of overestimating one\'s capabilities, demands humility and asks us to accept help. And it can mean the begin of a project that is going to need a lot of time and patience to be successful in the end.',
    'This cards symbolises both inner and outer wealth. It can mean wealth of talents, of money, of property, of feelings, of friends, of happiness... Often it also means that this wealth came to us all of a sudden, or that we suddenly realise it had been there for a long time already.',
    'The Ten of Pentacles stand for the kind of wealth that can be found in daily life. They stand for happiness with your family, for the small joys of life - garden, sunshine, a cup of tea, the sound of rain, the visit of a good friend... Those who know and appreciate this kind of wealth will hardly ever be discontented or unhappy. The card also means stability and security, it means safe, firm fundaments.',
    'I tend to reading the Pages as invitations to cultivate certain mental attitudes or to inwardly prepare for certain ways of acting. The Page of Pentacles invites us to practise patience. What we want to reach cannot be reached by hard labour, and it can\'t be reached at this istant. We can only get there if we remain patient and calm. So since wait we must, why not make ourselves comfortable while we wait - why not enjoy life now!',
    'Like the other knights the Knight of Pentacles stands for a certain spirit, and in his case this is the spirit of patience, of biding. The Knight of Pentacles has a solid basis of values and rules; he feels safe and grounded. Because of this grounding he can look reality calmly in the face. This is a spirit in which you know that you can do what is asked of you. You are diligent and have stamina, but you don\'t feel overly passionate. This is a spirit of deliberation. The Knight of Pentacles can be problematic if his grounding turns into rigidity and stubborness, his calmness to laziness .',
    'You can see the Queen of Pentacles as a woman with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a man, as the female part of his psyche. But I tend to reading the queens as the inward side of a person (philosophy of life, attitude towards life, values, habitus, typical moods...), no matter whether this person is female or male.\n' +
    'The Queen of Pentacles is a sensual and sensuous, comfortable, practical woman, she is creative and diligent. If she can\'t be creative or care for other people, animals or for her garden, she becomes unhappy. She is pragmatical, reliable and grounded, she loves the consistent. Sudden changes, adventures and also solitude frighten her. She needs a community.\n' +
    'The Queen of Pentacles can be problematic if she becomes rigidly conservative, greedy, niggardly or obsessive. And her need to make everything as nice as possible for everyone can exhaust her.',
    'You can see the King of Pentacles as a man with the following qualities or, if the the question concerns a woman, as the male part of her psyche. But I tend to reading the kings as the outward side of a person (job, typical ways of acting, the way the life is led...), no matter whether this person is male or female.\n' +
    'The King of Pentacles is a calm, steady person, conscious of values and tradition. He is rooted to the earth, is pragmatical, practical and knows the worth of property, good food, entertainment and other joys of the senses. He is reliable and loyal. The King of Pentacles can be problematic if the consciousnes of values and tradition turns into rigid conservatism and patriarchy, if the pragmatism turns into mental rigour and the cherishing of material goods into niggardliness or crapulousness.'
